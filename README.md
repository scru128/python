# SCRU128: Sortable, Clock and Random number-based Unique identifier

SCRU128 ID is yet another attempt to supersede [UUID] in the use cases that need
decentralized, globally unique time-ordered identifiers. SCRU128 is inspired by
[ULID] and [KSUID] and has the following features:

- 128-bit unsigned integer type
- Sortable by generation time (as integer and as text)
- 26-character case-insensitive portable textual representation
- 44-bit biased millisecond timestamp that ensures remaining life of 550 years
- Up to 268 million time-ordered but unpredictable unique IDs per millisecond
- 84-bit _layered_ randomness for collision resistance

```python
from scru128 import scru128

print(scru128()) # e.g. "00PGHAJ3Q9VAJ7IU6PQBHBUAK4"
print(scru128()) # e.g. "00PGHAJ3Q9VAJ7KU6PQ92NVBTV"
```

## Command-line interface

`scru128` generates SCRU128 IDs.

```bash
$ scru128
00PP7O1FIQFM7C7R8VBK61T94N
$ scru128 -n 4
00PP7OKSN7T37CR12PEIJILTA1
00PP7OKSN7T37CT12PEJKN2BNO
00PP7OKSN7T37CV12PEH41TP72
00PP7OKSN7T37D112PEI1L0HMS
```

`scru128-inspect` prints the components of given SCRU128 IDs as human- and
machine-readable JSON objects.

```bash
$ scru128 -n 2 | scru128-inspect
{
  "input":        "00PP7OUAC22A7TO4VESB1R83L5",
